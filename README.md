This code prints the multiplication table from 1 to 9.

 The outer loop for a in range(1, 10): iterates through numbers from 1 to 9 — this is the first number in the multiplication (the multiplicand).

  The inner loop for b in range(1, 10): also iterates through numbers from 1 to 9 — this is the second number in the multiplication (the multiplier).

  Inside the inner loop, the line print(f"{a} * {b} = {a*b}") prints the result of multiplying a and b in string format, for example:
  2 * 3 = 6

Thus, the program prints all possible combinations of multiplication from 1 to 9, line by line.
